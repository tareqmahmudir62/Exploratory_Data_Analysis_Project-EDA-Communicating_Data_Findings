# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project-EDA-Communicating_Data_Findings
This is an EDA project and the main objective of this project was to learn how to communicate data findings before the Data Visualization phase.


# (Loan Data from Prosper)

## Dataset
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This dataset will be used to answer certain questions like:

What factors affect a loan’s outcome status?
What affects the borrower’s APR or interest rate?
Are there differences between loans depending on how large the original loan amount was?

## Summary of Findings

Those who belong to the 'Employed' employment status earns more than any other employment status. And those whose income range is more than 100,000, their chance of getting the loan is higher than any other income range. One can assume the borrower rate based on the original loan amount. As the loan amount increases the borrower rate decreases. And at the same time, there is a positive correlation between Original loan amount and prosper score. With the increased prosper score the chance of getting a high first loan amount increases. Getting a loan is not depedent on wheher a brrower owns a house or nat rather it depends on prosper score, employment status and income range.It is surprising to see that the borrower with full time employment status are more inquired than the other employment status. And, the Loan Original Amount and Borrower Rate depend on the Borrower's prosper score

## Key Insights for Presentation

1. People, who are employed gets the loan most of the times followed by Full-time employment status. Interestingly, people with not-employment status get loans more than those who are retired or doing part-time jobs.
2. The data project that if the income range is more than or equal to $100,000 then the borrower gets the highest amount of loan (on an average). The overall boxplot is trying to depicts that how much a borrower will get as loan amount is dependent on his/her/their income range
3. The data displays that the more the propsper score the less the borrower rate. It can be said that the BorrowerRate is higly dependent on the ProsperScore.
